# Creating a DynamoDB using Python Scripts and AWS Cloud9

## Description

For this project, we are going to create a DynamoDB table within Amazaon AWS and populate it with data about sneakers using Python scripts. Everything is going to be done within an AWS Cloud9 environment. The code provided in this repository is for the two necessary Python scripts (one to create the database, the other to load the data), and a JSON file that contains the actual data.

This is a very simple table, but you can use the code as a basis for creating more elaborate or detailed DynamoDB tables

## Objectives

1. Create a Dynamodb table for my sneakers that has a partition key of the "Name of the brand" 
and sort key for the "Name of the sneaker model"
2. Use Python to create scripts for creating table and loading data
3. Do everything within an AWS Cloud9 Environment

## Prerequisites

1. AWS Account (everything done here will be on the free tier)
2. Python scripts and JSON data file (included in this repository)

# Instructions

1. Create a Cloud9 IDE from your AWS account
2. Upload
